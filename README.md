### Project Overview

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the â€œDiabetes_Patients.csv" file, containing detailed information about each patient. 

### Tools 

1. Excel - Data Cleaning
2. PowerBl - Creating Visualisation & reports 

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks: 
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

I found several variables, some of which are independent (several medical predictor variables), and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

### Insights

I got insightful information that includes, but is not limited to the following:

1. The more pregnancies a woman has, the less chance she has of having diabetes.
2. The higher the average blood pressure, the fewer the chances of having diabetes.
3.   As women age, the incidence of diabetes and other diseases decreases etc.
 

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from the dataset because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions.
